Raw data for the paper "Exploring Kaneko’s bound: On multi-edges, loops and the diameter of the supersingular ℓ-isogeny graph" ([ADDLINKHERE])

- The file `different_field_primes.sage` contains the maximal primes $d(\ell) < 4\ell^2$ such that a double edge exists between vertices whose $j$-invariants are not $0$ or $1728$ and lie in different fields (Corollary 21).
- The file `double_double_primes.sage` contains the maximal primes $b(\ell) < 4\ell^4$ such that multiple multi-edges originate from a vertex whose $j$-invariant is not $0$ or $1728$ (Corollary 17).
- The file `generic_triple_primes.sage` contains the maximal primes $p(\ell) < 4\ell^3$ such that a triple edge originates from a vertex whose $j$-invariant is not $0$ (Theorem 15).
- The file `loop_double_primes.sage` contains the maximal primes $a(\ell) < 4\ell^3$ such that both a loop and a double edge originate from a vertex whose $j$-invariant is not $0$ or $1728$ (Corollary 19).
- The file `rational_triple_primes.sage` contains the maximal primes $r(\ell) < 4\ell^2$ such that a triple edge originates from a vertex whose $j$-invariant lies in the unit group of the prime field (Proposition 22).
- The file `special_loop_0_primes.sage` contains the maximal primes $g_0(\ell) < 3\ell$ such that there are more loops than expected at the $j$-invariant $0$ (Theorem 5(b)).
- The file `special_loop_1728_primes.sage` contains the maximal primes $g_{1728}(\ell) < 4\ell$ such that there are more loops than expected at the $j$-invariant $1728$ (Theorem 5(a)).
- The file `special_neigh_0_primes.sage` contains the maximal primes $n_0(\ell) < 3\ell^2$ such that the $j$-invariant $0$ has less neighbors than expected (Theorem 6(b)).
- The file `special_neigh_1728_primes.sage` contains the maximal primes $n_{1728}(\ell) < 4\ell^2$ such that the $j$-invariant $1728$ has less neighbors than expected (Theorem 6(a)).
- The file `special_path_primes.sage` contains the maximal primes $s(m) < 3m^2$ such that the $j$-invariants $0$ and $1728$ are connected via a cyclic $m$-isogeny (Proposition 29).
- The file `triple_loop_primes.sage` contains the maximal primes $g(\ell) < 4\ell^2$ such that there is a triple loop in the supersingular isogeny graph (Proposition 18).
